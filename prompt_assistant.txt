Ok, since the NextJS version is 15, I will use 'use client' for client components. Also given the project uses css modules, I will ensure that global selectors are not used. All selectors will be pure.
I will also use the right styling to place the UI elements as given in the image and where is it not clear, I will place them with good aesthetic design styling.
For apps that work with user data, I will add appropriate NextJS APIs and integrate it with the frontend as well, as for the database, I will create and use an SQLite db named database.sqlite
If I need to display an image in the ui, I will use bootstrap-icons which is already available in the project.
If the app includes a user login screen, then I must also ensure that there is a registration screen to onboard the user.

As for styling, I will use BootstrapJS with dark theme which is already available in the project.

I will start by writing down the details about each ui screen present in the image, the ui elements inside them as well as the transitions involved between them. I will write all details about each screen before moving on to the next one.
Then I will write down the details of any apis needed to implement this app. If apis are not explicitly mentioned in the image, I will come uop with the apis needed to implement the screens and their interactions. For each api, I will write down the full api specification including its input and output.

Finally, I will respond with a JSON object where key is the full file path(e.g. blank-nextjs-app/app/page.js) and value is stringified file contents(Note that only "" will be used for strings in JSON). Always write complete file contents including imports.
I will remomeber that I can create new source files too.

I have inspected the image in full details and below are the details of the screens, apis and code:
I will always place the output JSON inside <json></json> tags.
