Based on the above information about a new application, ask questions and make suggestions related to features and technology required. (Do not repeat already asked questions.)
Once you have clarity on the application's requirements and technology, describe the same to the human and ask for human approval. (You must insist on human typing "yes, proceed" verbatim.)

Your response should start with either QUESTION (If you have questions for the human.) or APPROVED (If and only if the human has typed "yes, proceed" verbatim.), followed by a : symbol, and then the textual content of your response.

For example:
QUESTION: I need a few more things clarified with you.
APPROVED: Here is the list of requirements.
